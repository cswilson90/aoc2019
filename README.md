Code for [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019/)

I'm using this as practice to learn TypeScript so the code is likely not very good.

Requires [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

Tested on TypeScript `4.3.5` and NodeJS `16.6.1`

To build run:

```
$ tsc
```

To run the code for a particular day execute `lib/day<day>.js` e.g. for day 3:

```
$ node lib/day3.js
```
